## Problem Statement

How do you show you can code if you have only worked in private git repos?

![no code 2021](images/no_code_2021.png)

![no code 2022](images/no_code_2022.png)

## Project Background (also found at the botton of [project landing page](https://commit-stats.ealbert.org/) )


I was applying for developer jobs and I couldn't show my coding experience.
The code repositories I had been working on were in different git providers (Gitlab & Azure DevOps) and the code was **private**.

As I am a bit of a data nerd ðŸ¤“ I like to track different metrics.
Not only commits, PRs, but also LoC (Lines of Code), open source contribution, 3rd-party packages, etc.
Therefore, the two main goals of the project are:

1. Support creating a "CV" page of your commit stats that you can use when applying for jobs
2. (Future) Support weekly feedback on your code and reflect on your developer journey

I hope you will find it useful and fun ðŸ˜Ž
Happy coding!

## Product Demo 1

- "CV/Dashboard" of your commits across languages

![alt text](images/product_espen_cv.png)

---

## Product Demo 2

- How to collect the commits:

1. Login with Github
2. Add your token

![alt text](images/product_token_steps.png)

---

## Product Demo 3

- Select your repos
- Full Collection Status & Open Source Repos


![alt text](images/product_token_status.png)

# Part 2: Behind the scenes discussions

- Questions:
  1. How would you build this?
  2. Which AWS Services?
  3. Other SaaS products?
  4. Programming language?
  5. Commit to deployment workflow?
  6. Database technology?

## Tech stack decisions

- What stack would you choose?

<v-click>

- I'm a Python fan and inspired by Samuel Colvin starting the [pydantic company](https://github.com/pydantic)
  - [Pydantic Services Inc. emerges from stealth today with $4.7 million in seed funding led by Sequoia](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/sequoia-backs-open-source-data-validation-framework-pydantic-to-commercialize-with-cloud-services/)
- Wanted to use [FastUI](https://github.com/pydantic/FastUI)
  - [7.1k stars in a few months](https://star-history.com/#pydantic/FastUI&Date)

<Transform :scale="0.75">

## Artifacts Produced

- classic static files
  - `index.css`
  - `index.html`
  - `index.js`
  - +++
- zip files for the lambda functions
- or a docker image

</v-click>
<v-click>

## Tech candidates

- Plotly Dash
- Your Choice?

</v-click>

---

## AWS Organization

- Would you use than more than one AWS account?

<v-click>

- Root account
  - Route53
  - IAM Config
  - ECR
- `{Project Name}` Account: CommitStats
  - Billing separate
  - Need access to route53 to add DNS records
- Terraform Basic Needs
  - S3 with replication
  - KMS (Optional -> can be costly)

</v-click>

## How to deploy the artifacts? Lambda/ECS/EC2?

- Artifacts reminder
  - Static files (index.css|html|js ++)
  - aws zip files
  - docker images?
- What would you choose and why?

<v-click>

- I chose Lambda

<Transform :scale="0.85">

![alt text](images/lambda_functions.png)

</Transform>
</v-click>

::right::


<Transform :scale="0.65">
<div class="ml-10">

<v-clicks>

- Why images? [250MB limit on Lambda functions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54632009/how-to-increase-the-maximum-size-of-the-aws-lambda-deployment-package-requesten)
  - Python packages ðŸ˜±

  ```
  144M python3.11/site-packages//plotly
  89M python3.11/site-packages//pyarrow
  81M python3.11/site-packages//botocore
  71M python3.11/site-packages//pandas
  60M python3.11/site-packages//numpy
  42M python3.11/site-packages//dash
  ```

- How to choose memory size?
- How to trigger lambdas?
  - EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)
  - Supports schedule: `cron(0/15 ** *?*)` or `rate(1 minute)`
  - Specific event publishing by using `detail-type`, see `events.tf`
- Lambda cold start problem
  - [Provisioned concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/provisioned-concurrency.html) to the rescue? [redit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/nh4nc0/aws_lambda_provisioned_concurrency_vs_keeping_a/)
  - 10 Ã— 0.000004167 Ã— 0.5 Ã— 86400 = $1.80/day, or $54/month

## Staticfiles, CDN, APIs, CORS, and SPA how do you do the routing?

- Any suggestions?
- Fell on my face quite hard
  - Splitting the API into more services got complicated

---

## Database technology?
---

## Testing? Multiple environments? CI workflows?

- lambda versioning? aliases?

---

# Questions?
