## Problem Statement

How do you show you can code if you have only worked in private git repos?

![no code 2021](images/no_code_2021.png)

![no code 2022](images/no_code_2022.png)

---

## Project Background (also found at the botton of [project landing page](https://commit-stats.ealbert.org/) )


I was applying for developer jobs and I couldn't show my coding experience.
The code repositories I had been working on were in different git providers (Gitlab & Azure DevOps) and the code was **private**.

As I am a bit of a data nerd ðŸ¤“ I like to track different metrics.
Not only commits, PRs, but also LoC (Lines of Code), open source contribution, 3rd-party packages, etc.
Therefore, the two main goals of the project are:

> 1. **Support creating a "CV" page of your commit stats that you can use when applying for jobs**
> 2. **(Future) Support weekly feedback on your code and reflect on your developer journey**


I hope you will find it useful and fun ðŸ˜Ž
Happy coding!

## Tech stack decision

- What stack would you choose?

<v-click>

- I'm a Python fan and inspired by Samuel Colvin starting the [pydantic company](https://github.com/pydantic)
  - [Pydantic Services Inc. emerges from stealth today with $4.7 million in seed funding led by Sequoia](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/sequoia-backs-open-source-data-validation-framework-pydantic-to-commercialize-with-cloud-services/)
- Wanted to use [FastUI (FastAPI + React)](https://github.com/pydantic/FastUI)
  - [7.1k stars in a few months](https://star-history.com/#pydantic/FastUI&Date)
- [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/dashboards/dashboards-with-react)

### Artifacts Produced

- classic static files
  - `index.css`
  - `index.html`
  - `index.js`
  - +++
- zip files for the lambda functions
- or a docker image

## How to deploy the artifacts? (Lambda/ECS/EC2?)

- Artifacts reminder
  - Static files (index.css|html|js ++)
  - aws zip files
  - docker images?
- What would you choose and why?

<v-click>

- I chose Lambda

- Why images? [250MB limit on Lambda functions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54632009/how-to-increase-the-maximum-size-of-the-aws-lambda-deployment-package-requesten)
  - Python packages ðŸ˜±

  ```

  89M python3.11/site-packages//pyarrow
  81M python3.11/site-packages//botocore

  - Supports schedule: `cron(0/15 ** *?*)` or `rate(1 minute)`
  - Specific event publishing by using `detail-type`, see `events.tf`
- Lambda cold start problem

<!-- 
1. Why zips? Faster packaging. No requirement on an ECR (Docker Hub instead?) 
2. Limiting costs with ECR lifecycle rule
3. Trail and error RAM size
4. Ask for cold start problem solutions

### Routing Part 2: Lambda @ Edge

```python{all|7-10|1-3,11-13|14-|18}
ALL_S3_DOCUMENTS = set(['CodeLazy.js', 'CodeLazy.js.map', 'MarkdownLazy.js', 
'MarkdownLazy.js.map', 'index.css', 'index.html', 
'index.js', 'index.js.map'])

def lambda_handler(event, context) -> dict | None:
    """based on example: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-examples.html#lambda-examples-redirect-to-signin-page"""

    print(f"path is: {path}")
    s3_path = path.lstrip("/")

                }
            ]
        },
    }
```

### Routing Part 3: Lambda @ Edge

- inside of python script: `_html=`

```html{all|6|7-8}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CommitStats Landing Page</title>
    <script type="module" crossorigin src="/index.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/index.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root" class="highcharts-light"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

<!-- Maybe someone knows better about crossorigin attribute? -->
---

### Routing Part 4: API Gateway

- [AWS API Gateway](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/develop/routes?api=gjwn13z2g8&integration=rnf8hmg&region=eu-west-1&routes=qls5ftn)
- Anyone experience with multiple stages?
---

### Routing Part 5: Lessons Learned

<v-clicks>

- Tip: Avoid splitting up APIs if you can
  - Fell on my face quite hard
    - CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
      - Where to add the headers?
      - Do one thing at a time
- Tip: Invalidating cache
  - Anyone knows how to do it with Terraform?

</v-clicks>

---

## SaaS products?

<v-clicks>

### Database?

1. [MongoDB Atlas with Free Forever (up to 512MB)](https://www.mongodb.com/pricing)
   1. Use AWS KMS to encrypt the tokens
2. [InfluxDB Cloud Serverless ($250 in free credits for 90 days)](https://www.influxdata.com/influxdb-pricing/)
3. Alternatives
   1. Elasticsearch
   2. RDS (PostgreSQL)
   3. DynamoDB
   4. DocumentDB?

### Message Queue alternatives?

1. EventBridge
2. [Kafka (Confluence)](https://www.confluent.io/cloud-kafka)
3. Redis?
4. [RabbitMQ](https://www.cloudamqp.com/)

</v-clicks>

---

## AWS Organization?

- Would you use than more than one AWS account?

<v-click>

- Root account
  - Route53
  - IAM Config
  - ECR
- `{Project Name}` Account: CommitStats
  - Billing separate
  - Need access to route53 to add DNS records (Terraform and `assume_role` to the rescue)
- Terraform Basic Needs
  - S3 with replication
  - KMS (Optional -> can be costly)

</v-click>

<!-- Out of scope to talk about a professional company -->

---

## Cost of the solution?

<v-clicks>

- Which AWS service do you think is the most expensive?
- KMS
  - Stopped encrypting terraform state to save money
- [Cost Explorer](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/home?region=eu-west-1#/cost-explorer?chartStyle=STACK&costAggregate=unBlendedCost&endDate=2024-03-31&excludeForecasting=false&filter=%5B%5D&futureRelativeRange=CUSTOM&granularity=Monthly&groupBy=%5B%22Service%22%5D&historicalRelativeRange=LAST_6_MONTHS&isDefault=true&reportName=New%20cost%20and%20usage%20report&showOnlyUncategorized=false&showOnlyUntagged=false&startDate=2023-10-01&usageAggregate=undefined&useNormalizedUnits=false)
- InfluxDB, most costly for now ($2.49 for February)
  - Data out $0.17 for 1.88GB
  - Data In $1.59 for 635.851 MB
  - Query count $0.64 for 5342 queries (0.012 per 100 query executions)
  - Storage:$0.09 for 43.461 GB-hr

</v-clicks>

<!-- Mention story about being a student, pushing credentials, and having a 20k bill over night -->

---

## Multiple environments? CI workflows?

- What if you need to host stage/QA environments?
  - Recreate the full terraform with a new environment or re-use infrastructure
- lambda versioning? aliases?
- Time for a live deployment?

---

## Quality checks & Local testing

- Time for a demo?

---


## Future of the Project

- Alternative to InfluxDB for hosting
- Improved on-boarding experience
- [More in the `Future ideas` section](https://commit-stats.ealbert.org/)

---

# Questions?

- Observability tools?
  - Sentry?
  - OTEL - Open Telemetry
  - ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
  - Cloudwatch
